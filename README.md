# BL4P

BL4P (pronounced: BLAP) is a cryptocurrency exchange that only holds users' fiat
currency.
BL4P's atomic swap functionality allows users to exchange fiat and
cryptocurrency between each other, for instance using the Lightning network.
The concept was described earlier in:

https://gitlab.bitonic.nl/Corne/Lightning-integration-concepts/blob/master/Decentralized_exchange_bank_style.md

This project contains the following:

* The fiat-managing server
* The marketplace server (centralized, for now)

# Installation

Requires:

* Python 3
* Protoc protobuf compiler (in Debian: protobuf-compiler package)
